If you're interested in Memgraph Enterprise, you need to fill out the following
[form](https://memgraph.com/enterprise-trial) where one of the fields is the organization name.

After getting your license key, set the `organization.name` to the same
organization name you used for the license key, and the `enterprise.license` to
the license key you received by running the following queries: 

```
SET DATABASE SETTING 'organization.name' TO 'Organization';
SET DATABASE SETTING 'enterprise.license' TO 'License';
```

To check the set values run: 

```opencypher
SHOW DATABASE SETTING 'organization.name';
SHOW DATABASE SETTING 'enterprise.license';
```

or:

```opencypher
SHOW DATABASE SETTINGS;
```
