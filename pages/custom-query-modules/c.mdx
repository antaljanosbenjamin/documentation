# Developing a custom query module in C

All the C query modules that depend on the C API need to be compiled to a shared library so that they can be loaded
when Memgraph starts. 
This means that you can write the procedures in any programming language that can work with C API and be compiled to the ELF shared
library format (`.so`).  
For more information, check the [C API referenceguide](/custom-query-modules/c/c-api). 

We also made [an example module](/custom-query-modules/c/c-example) to help you
start developing your own modules.

If you love diving into the code,`mg_procedure.h` can be found in Memgraph
installation directory `/usr/include/memgraph`  and it contains declarations of all
functions that can be used to implement a query module procedure. To compile the
module, you will have to pass the appropriate flags to the compiler, for
example, `clang`:

```plaintext
clang -Wall -shared -fPIC -I /usr/include/memgraph example.c -o example.so
```
