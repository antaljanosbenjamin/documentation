# Manage Memgraph in Linux native enviroment

Learn the best practices for managing your Memgraph instance in the Native Linux 
environment. This guide will cover the most common task you might need to do while 
configuring and running Memgraph in the Linux native enviroment. 

Keep in mind that links from this guide will take you to the other documentation pages
that cover the specific topic in more detail.

## Install Memgraph on Linux 

To install Memgraph on Linux, you need to download the apropriate packagage from the 
[Memgraph download page](https://memgraph.com/download). The installation process is
straightforward and it is covered in the [Memgraph installation guide](/getting-started/install-memgraph).


For a native Linux deployment you can only use the base Memgraph package, there is no Memgraph Mage package
available for Linux. For running Memgraph Mage, you can use the Docker image. 

Once Memgraph is installed you can use `systemd` to manage the Memgraph service.
Here is an example of how to start, stop and restart Memgraph service:

```bash
sudo systemctl start memgraph
sudo systemctl stop memgraph
sudo systemctl restart memgraph
sudo systemctl status memgraph
```

## Connect to Memgraph

By deafult, Memgraph listens on port `7687` for Bolt protocol. That means you
can connect to Memgraph using any of the [client libraries](/client-libraries)
or the [mgconsole](/cli) CLI tool.

Memgraph pre-installs the `mgconsole` CLI tool, so you can connect to Memgraph
by running the following command:

```bash
mgconsole --host=127.0.0.1 --port=7687
```

You can use the `mgconole` in the interactive or non-interactive mode. For
setting up the Memgraph and running setup scripts. To connect to Memgraph from
remote machines, you need to change the `--host` parameter to the proper IP
address. 

The same goes for using a client library, you need to provide the proper IP
address and port number. The client needs to be in the same network as the
Memgraph instance, or the Memgraph instance needs to be exposed to the internet.

If you are unable to connect to remote Memgraph instance, keep in mind that your
firewall enviroment my be blocking the connection to Memgraph.

## Configure Memgraph

Memgraph has its configuration settings persisted in the `memgraph.conf` file
located in the `/etc/memgraph` folder. Some of the most commonly configured
settings are:

- `--log-level=WARNING`
- `--query-execution-timeout-sec=600`
- `--storage-snapshot-interval-sec=300	`
- `--storage-snapshot-retention-count=3`
- `--storage-mode=IN_MEMORY_TRANSACTIONAL`

Of course, other
[settings](../database-management/configuration.mdx#list-of-configuration-flags)
are as important, so make sure you get familiar with them as well.

To change the configuration settings, you need to open and edit the
`memgraph.conf` file and restart the Memgraph service. 

The set flags override the default settings in the `memgraph.conf` file. It is
also possible to provide additional configuration file by providing path to it
via `--file-flag` or `MEMGRAPH_CONFIG` environment variable. The set values in
that file will override values in the default `memgraph.conf` file.

## Data persistency 

Data persistency is a crucial aspect of running a database. You want to keep
your data Persistent if anything goes wrong. Memgraph stores different types of
information to different places. 

Here are the locations of different types of data that Memgraph uses: 

- Configuration files: `/etc/memgraph`
- Logs: `/var/log/memgraph`
- User related data: `/usr/lib/memgraph`
- Graph data: `/var/lib/memgraph`

Based on what you want to backup, consider copying any of the listed folders to
a safe location.

## Backup data

Memgraph uses the graph data that is stored in the `snapshots` and `wal-files`
folders for persistency, they enable the database and graph to recover in case
of a crash. The snapshots and wal-files folders are good candidates for backup,
they are part of the `/var/lib/memgraph` folder. 

If you want to restore the data, all you need to do is start a new Memgraph
instance with different data directory by using the `--data-directory` flag and
pointing it to a backup folder. 

Also if you are using query modules and custom configuration files, make sure to
backup those as well. The query modules are stored in the `/usr/lib/memgraph`. 


### Copy the data persistence folder 

The easiest and most reliable way to backup the graph data is to copy the whole
`/var/lib/memgraph` folder.  

First run the following query in Memgraph to lock the data directory in order to
avoid changes happening during the backup proces

```cypher
LOCK DATA DIRECTORY;
```

After that, copy the data persistency folder onto your local file system:

```bash
cp -rp /var/lib/memgraph /path/to/my/local-folder
```

Notice that the `-p` flag is used to preserve the file ownership and
permissions.

In the end, unlock the data directly by running the following query in Memgraph:

```cypher
UNLOCK DATA DIRECTORY;
```

### Dump database

Anoter approach is to dump the database into a file. This is useful if you want
to move the data between different Memgraph versions that might have
incompatible data formats, for snapshots or wal files. 

To dump the database, you can use the `mgconsole` CLI tool. Here is an example
of how to dump the database into a file:

```bash
echo "DUMP DATABASE;" | mgconsole --output-format=cypherl > data.cypherl
```

Keep in mind that the `cypherl` format is used for dumping the database. Whole
graph data is stored in the `data.cypherl` file, this means that the import
process can take a while, since the whole graph data is stored in the single
file. 

You should prefer the copying of the data persistency folder over the dumping
the database, since it is significantly faster. 

## Restore data

Depending on the backup method you used, you can restore data in the different way. 
If you have copied the data persistency folder, you can simply copy the folder back to the 
custom location and start the Memgraph instance with the `--data-directory` flag
pointing to the restored folder. 

The backup data folder should be owned by the Memgraph user, so make sure the folder 
is acessible for read and write operations by the Memgraph user. 

Putting the backup folder back to `/var/lib/` path is recommended, since you will avoid 
issues with ownership. 

If you have dumped the database, you can import the data back into Memgraph by 
using the `mgconsole` CLI tool or the client library.


### Upgrading Memgraph

Keep in mind that between different version of Memgraph, we might break the
compatibility of the configurations, snapshots and wal-files. 
This is done very rarely, but it usefull to keep and eye on the [release
notes](https://memgraph.com/docs/release-notes) to se if there are any breaking
changes.

- Can I monitor the db? How? Websocket, HTTP (enterprise)


## Where to next?

Docker is a powerful tool, and it is usually a good starting point. If your
application involves multiple services besides a database, you might want to
create a multi-container application with Docker Compose. To learn more about
how to manage Memgraph in such environment, follow our Docker Compose guide.
